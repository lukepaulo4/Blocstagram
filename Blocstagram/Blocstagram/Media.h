//Track which media items have been downloaded, and which still need to be downloaded. Start by declaring an enumeration in Media.h.  typedef NS_ENUM delcares MediaDownloadState as equivalent to NSInteger, with four predefined values. Now MediaDownloadState can theoretically be used anywhere as NSInteger

//We use the @class User instead of just adding #import User.h because it is poor practice to import custom classes inside a header file. It causes an error called circular inclusion. BUT THEN THEY SAY FUCK IT AND WE ADDED IT ABOVE ANYWAYS???????
